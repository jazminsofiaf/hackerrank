# Problem

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Sample Input :
s: `badeaebcaae´
t: `aabc´

## Sample Output :
`bcaa´
